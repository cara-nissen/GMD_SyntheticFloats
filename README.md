# Analysis scripts for "LIGHT-bgcArgo-1.0: using synthetic float capabilities in E3SMv2 to assess spatiotemporal variability in ocean physics and biogeochemistry"
Code for data postprocessing and figure creation in Nissen et al. (2024), Geoscientific Model Development, DOI: 10.5194/gmd-17-6415-2024

## Plotting 

Scripts are named following the figure numbering in the paper. 

## Post-processing

These scripts are needed to postprocess the original model output. The scripts create netcdf files or text files which are read in by the plotting scripts. 

Original and postprocessed model output can be found on Globus (see data availability statement in paper for details).
